Twitter Mapper (final project for Software Construction Object Oriented Design)

This folder contains the core files for the Twitter Mapper project. For the project to run, JMapViewer-2.3 and twitter4j-4.0.4 is needed.

Project description: "For the project you will complete a graphical Java application called The Twitter Mapper. This application allows the user to specify keywords of interest, and monitors tweets from a service that samples Twitter in real time (or replays tweets that were previously recorded). It also plots the location of the user the originated the tweet on a map of the world. To do this, the app makes use of an existing geographical mapping library and the Twitter API."
